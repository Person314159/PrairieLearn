# Motivation and Background

Currently, creating a new PrairieLearn question involves manually writing HTML code, which can be a barrier to some instructors. This RFC proposes a more visual question editing process so that instructors can create questions much more easily. This should simplify the process of creating and modifying questions for instructors with no programming or HTML experience. It also proposes an interface for setting question and assessment configuration options.
